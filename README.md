# Relatory
I tried to get ineerHTML generated by javascript with Selenium and Chrome --headless, but unfortunally my WLS do not support google-chrome, so with no access to DOM the is no option to automate this part of task.

# Usage
Before run hook_graph.py put the <div class="cell code_cell unselected rendered" tabindex="2">, that can be easily finded at DOM inspector, into the clipboard.
  
# Dependencies
python3 -m pip install clipboard
